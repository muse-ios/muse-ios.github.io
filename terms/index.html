      <h2>1. Acknowledgement &amp; Acceptance</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") constitute a legal agreement between you ("User") and Muse ("Developer," "we," or "us") regarding your use of the Muse mobile application ("App").</p>
      <p>By downloading, installing, or using the App, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>These Terms are concluded between you and the Developer only, and not with Apple, Inc. ("Apple").</li>
        <li>The Developer, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App and the content thereof.</li>
        <li>You agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>Muse is a movie recommendation utility that presents curated film suggestions through an interactive interface. The App allows you to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select movie preferences (genre, era, origin, duration).</li>
        <li>Receive personalized movie recommendations via a cinematic spin interaction.</li>
        <li>Maintain a local or cloud-synced archive of your movie picks.</li>
        <li>Sign in with Apple to synchronize data across devices via Google Firebase.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. User Accounts &amp; Data</h2>

      <h3>3.1. Anonymous Usage</h3>
      <p>You may use the App without creating an account. In this case, your data is stored locally on your device or associated with an anonymous identifier. Anonymous data cannot be recovered if the App is deleted or the device is lost.</p>

      <h3>3.2. Apple Sign-In</h3>
      <p>You may choose to sign in using your Apple ID. By doing so, you authorize us to link your data to a unique user ID provided by Apple's authentication service. This allows for data synchronization across devices.</p>

      <h3>3.3. Account Security</h3>
      <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your device access and account. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.</p>

      <h2>4. Purchases and Payments</h2>

      <h3>4.1. Free Tier</h3>
      <p>The App offers limited free usage, which may include a set number of daily interactions or restricted access to specific filters. We reserve the right to modify the limitations of the free tier at any time.</p>

      <h3>4.2. Muse Premium (Lifetime Access)</h3>
      <p>Muse Premium is a "Non-Consumable" In-App Purchase that permanently unlocks premium features and removes daily limits.</p>

        <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Family Sharing:</strong> If enabled by us and supported by Apple, this purchase may be shareable with your family group.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3. Refunds</h3>
      <p>All purchases are processed directly by Apple. We do not have the ability to process refunds. Refund requests must be submitted directly to Apple Support in accordance with their refund policies.</p>
