      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Muse ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the Muse mobile application (the "App").</p>
      <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By downloading and using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign in with Apple, we receive your Apple ID credential, email address (which may be a private relay address if you choose to hide your email), and display name (if provided).</li>
        <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> We collect your movie preference data (genre, era, origin, duration) to generate recommendations.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data (Signature):</strong> Your "Pact" signature is stored locally on your device via SwiftData and is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous information about how you interact with the App, including movie picks, your "Archive" (watch history), and session duration.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect device type, operating system version (iOS version), and unique device identifiers (Installation IDs) for crash reporting and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash Logs:</strong> In the event of an error, we collect log data containing details of the crash to help us fix the issue.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Information from Third Parties</h3>
      <p>We utilize third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Processes your Muse Premium subscription status. We receive confirmation of your purchase type (e.g., Lifetime) but do not have access to your credit card or financial information.</li>
        <li><strong>The Movie Database (TMDB):</strong> Movie metadata (titles, posters, overviews) is fetched from TMDB API. Your search queries may be processed by TMDB's servers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We process your data for the following legitimate interests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Functionality:</strong> To provide, operate, and maintain the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> To tailor movie recommendations based on your selected filters.</li>
        <li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> To sync your Archive and preferences across your devices using Google Firebase.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To understand user behavior and improve the App's stability (via Google Analytics for Firebase).</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send you push notifications regarding updates or recommendations (only with your explicit permission).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> Manages your identity securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Firestore:</strong> Stores your user profile and pick history in Google's secure cloud infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>On-Device Storage:</strong> Sensitive rituals (like signatures) are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
      <p>We may share data with the following third-party vendors solely for the purpose of operating the App. We recommend you review their Privacy Policies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Analytics for Firebase:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crashlytics Terms</a></li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>The Movie Database (TMDB):</strong> <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TMDB Privacy Policy</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location (including the EU/GDPR, California/CCPA, and Turkey/KVKK), you have certain rights regarding your data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access &amp; Correction:</strong> You can view and edit your preferences directly within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Delete (Erasure):</strong> You can delete your account at any time by navigating to Settings &gt; Profile &gt; Delete Account. This action permanently removes your data from our Firebase servers immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out of Analytics:</strong> You may opt-out of data collection by uninstalling the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> You can manage notification preferences in your device settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions like the EU). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If we discover that a child has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers.</p>

      <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction. By using the App, you consent to this transfer to Google's global server infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
